# Owlhacks2025

Welcome to our OwlHacks 2025 Hackathon project! Below you will find a description of our project and how to run it on your own computer:

From food to skincare to cleaning supplies, labels are often confusing and inconsistent. For people with allergies, one mistake can lead to a serious reactionâ€”or worse. We wanted to change that. So we asked ourselves: What if there was a way to instantly know whether something is safe for you, anytime, anywhere?

What it does:
Our app helps people with allergies shop, cook, and connect safely by offering:
  -Personalized profiles where users can save their allergens. 
  -Barcode scanning (or manual entry) for food, cosmetics, and household products. 
  -Custom shopping lists to organize safe products. 
  -Recipe generation based on ingredients from your list. 
  -An AI chatbot to answer questions about foods that may trigger your allergens. 
  -A supportive community where users can explore and share threads, TikToks, and Instagram posts tailored to their specific allergens.
